# HomeCoins

# Intro

This product is a web based "to-do" with a fun twist developed for family households
to inspire kids and parents to make a game out of doing chores.
As an admin user or parent you are charged with adding members of your family
and assign chores to them. They in turn can complete the chores and gather "HomeCoins"
to get on top of the leaderboard! It is up to you as a parent to deside if the homecoins 
can be traded in for "real world" treats such as an allowance or maybe candy?
